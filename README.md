# A Node.js Learning JourneyðŸ¤“

Hi, this repository documents my learning journey as I navigated the world of Node.js and its associated technologies. Started with no knowledge but just wanted to get my feet wet with building an extensive back-end with RESTful APIs.

## Project Overview

Started with an introduction to Node.js and npm, which laid the foundation for understanding the Node.js ecosystem. I then explored file operations, learning how to read and write files using Node.js.

I ventured into creating an event emitter and building a web server, two fundamental aspects of any Node.js application. This led me to Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js.

## Express.js and Middleware

In my exploration of Express.js, I started with setting up middleware and then moved on to routing, a critical component of any web application.

## MVC REST API and Authentication

The next phase of my journey involved creating a Model-View-Controller (MVC) REST API. I covered authentication for logging in and transitioned into a system for creating and storing employees. This included using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and setting up user roles.

## MongoDB and Mongoose

Finally, I was introduced to MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, and Mongoose, an elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js. I learned about Mongoose data models and concluded with asynchronous CRUD operations.

It was pleasant to see how everything I learned and implemented fit together and worked nicely. ThanksðŸ˜‹
